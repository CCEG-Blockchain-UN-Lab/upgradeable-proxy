This repository tests the proxy upgradeability mechanism. It is a simplified version of the system being used by the AragonOS and ZepplinOS system. The mechanism is exactly the same, just a few features have been removed.

To run
			git clone https://github.com/jackandtheblockstalk/upgradeable-proxy
			upgradeable-proxy
			truffle test
